## About

This is a simple Pong game where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. The game includes scoring and resets the ball when a player scores a point. It serves as an excellent introductory project for learning game development with Pygame.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (local, keyboard-controlled paddles)
- Real-time ball movement and collision detection
- Score tracking and display
- Keyboard controls to start/resume the game and move paddles
- Game reset after each point scored

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org).

2. Install the Pygame library, if not already installed:


3. Clone this repository or download the source code files.

## Usage

Run the main Python file (e.g., `pong.py`) using Python:


The game window will open, and you can start playing.

## Game Controls

- **W** and **S** keys to move the left paddle up and down
- **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys to move the right paddle up and down
- **P** to start/resume the ball movement
- **R** to reset the game (if implemented)

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects for paddle hits and scoring
- Add a menu screen and pause functionality
- Implement AI opponent for single-player mode
- Add adjustable difficulty levels
- Add smoother ball physics and angle based on paddle hit position
